Fony Tips 'n' Tricks
--------------------

* Use the middle mouse button or Shift key to choose a range of glyphs.
  Edit functions such as Copy/Paste, Boldify, Invert etc. will then
  apply to the selected range.

* If you hold the Shift key down while choosing an action from the Edit
  menu, such as "Invert" or "Mirror", the action will be performed for
  the whole font instead of just the currently selected glyph. This also
  works for actions in the Tools window.

* To make glyphs thinner, use Invert, then Boldify, then Invert again.

* Copying and pasting glyphs handles them as normal bitmap images, so
  glyphs can be pasted to and copied from any image editor.

* You can quickly double a font's size without making it look too
  pixelated by using the "Scale2x" button in the resize dialog.

* Quickly make a bolded version of your font by using the new "Boldify"
  feature available from the Edit menu.

* Easily grab a font from any image file by creating an empty font of
  the appropriate size and using the new "Import from Bitmap" feature.

* Last but not least, if you appreciate the long hours spent developing
  Fony, donate a little bit to ensure it will be developed further!
