   and you can now write a range of glyphs.

   a TrueType font, the Font Header dialog would appear beneath the
   main window and be inaccessible until alt-tabbing to Fony again.

1.3.3 (2007-07-13)

 RELEASE NOTES:
 This release has extensive internal modifications to enable Unicode
 support in the user interface on Windows 2000/XP/Vista. I have also
 changed the location Fony stores its settings in, so settings from
 previous versions will be ignored unfortunately.

 IMPROVEMENTS:
 * 1.3.3.7: Windows clipboard is now used for copy/paste operations, so
   glyphs can be copied between Fony instances and from/to other programs.
 * 1.3.3.5: Updated Russian translation.
 * Slightly improved the quality of TrueType font import.
 * Sacrificed fancy menu+toolbar for Unicode compliance. The GUI should
   now be about 98% Unicode compliant on Windows 2000/XP/Vista.

 BUG FIXES:
 * 1.3.3.6: Glyph preview areas and the Reset function were not correctly
   initialized when a glyph was selected in the Preview window.
 * 1.3.3.6: In some cases the last character was missing from font name.
 * 1.3.3.5: Changing first/last char in font header was bugged with
   monospaced fonts.
 * 1.3.3.5: Fixed crashes caused by some dialogs.
 * 1.3.3.5: Fixed glyph width problems with some monospaced font files.
 * 1.3.3.4: The Open File dialog window is no longer stuck to only
   showing Amiga fonts after importing an Amiga font.
 * 1.3.3.3: Fixed incorrectly formed resource table when saving FON files
   containing multiple fonts. This fixes the issue with Windows only
   seeing the first font in the file.
 * 1.3.3.2: Fixed issues with menu/toolbar when using XP visual themes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.2 (2007-06-18)

 ADDITIONS:
 * BDF font import and export. (Not perfect; I'll improve it for the
   next release if I can find more information on how all the metrics
   stuff is actually supposed to work.)
 * Russian translation (thanks solokot!).

 IMPROVEMENTS:
 * Finally understands command line file arguments so you can associate
   Fony with font file formats. (Well, only FON/FNT/BDF/FONT right now.)

 BUGFIXES
 * 1.3.2.2: Fixed FONTBOUNDINGBOX and PROPERTIES in exported BDF.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
